## Loading and preprocessing the data

The source data for this project is named `activity.zip` and can be
found in the working directory for the project. The first step to
perform for loading to unzip this file to extract the `activity.csv`
file into the working directory:

```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
```

The second step is to load the extracted `activity.csv` file into a data
frame and see what we have:

```{r}
source_data <- read.csv("activity.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
str(source_data)
summary(source_data)
```
